<h1>Who we are</h1>
<div id="maintext">
<p>
 First Hollywood Digital is a production management company focused on film and television.
 We are the new wave of film makers. We are the new generation, so school was not that far back. 
 We understand and and lived through the students problems since we graduated not very long ago. 
 We graduated film school in Los Angeles and we managed to produce several movies since then.
</p>
<p> 
 We have built network, we have gathered equipment and we are in the field of professionals with high standards and level of functionality.
</p> 

<p>
 Created and run by movie makers and individuals who are actively immersed in both the corporate and entertainment communities, First Hollywood Digital brings together high profile executives to collaboratively create, sell and distribute our products.
</p>
<p>
 We use our own equipment and we are focused on the quality and high spirit of our work. We are proud with what we do.
